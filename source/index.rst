Welcome to Geoinformatics Research Days 2026
======================

The *Geoinformatics Research Days* event is the annual gathering for geoinformatics experts in Finland, 
which has been arranged by the member universities of the 
**Finnish University Network for Geoinformatics (Fiuginet)** for over 10 years. The event will take place on May 11-12, 2026 and will be organized by *University of Helsinki* together with the *Fiuginet* network, 
hosted in *Helsinki, Finland.* 

Call for Submissions
======================

Geoinformatics Research Days welcomes contributions from all areas of geospatial research and applications, providing an open platform 
for sharing ideas, methods, and innovations across the discipline. This year's **spotlight theme, Geospatial Intelligence for Sustainable 
Futures**, explores how emerging forms of spatial intelligence and AI are transforming our understanding of people, places, and the 
complex systems that connect them. We invite submissions that link AI-driven geospatial innovation with questions of sustainability, 
resilience, accessibility, and spatial justice across scales—from everyday mobility to global change.

Topics of interest
----------------------

Submissions are welcome in, but not limited to, the following areas:

1. Geospatial Data Acquisition and Processing
2. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and Remote Sensing
3. Spatial Data Analysis and Visualization
4. Geospatial Algorithms and Modeling
5. User Cognition in Geospatial Applications
6. Geoinformatic Human-Computer Interaction
7. Location-Based Services and Geographic Information Retrieval
8. Big Data Analytics for Geospatial Applications
9. Spatial Data Infrastructures and Interoperability
10. Geoinformatics for Smart Cities and Urban Planning
11. Environmental Monitoring and Geospatial Solutions
12. Geoinformatics for Sustainable Development
13. Geospatial AI and Machine Learning Applications
14. Open Geospatial Science and Open Source Software

Your participation in the Geoinformatics Research Days 2026 will make a significant contributions, foster collaboration,
and shape the future of Geoinformatics. Together, let's advance the understanding and application of geospatial technologies 
for a more sustainable and interconnected world.
