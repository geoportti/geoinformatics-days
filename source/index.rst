Welcome
======================

The *Geoinformatics Research Days* event is the annual gathering for geoinformatics experts, 
which has been organized by the member universities of the **Finnish University Network for Geoinformatics (Fiuginet)** 
for over 10 years. The event will take place on **May 11-12, 2026**, and will be organized by *University of Helsinki* together 
with the *Fiuginet* network, hosted in *Helsinki, Finland.* In addition, the Geoinformatics Research Days 2026 will 
include the final event of the `Geospatial Challenge Camp 2026 <https://challenge-camp.geoportti.fi/>`_, where teams present their results.

Call for Submissions
======================

Geoinformatics Research Days welcomes contributions from all areas of geospatial research and applications, providing an open platform 
for sharing ideas, methods, and innovations across the discipline. This year's **spotlight theme, Geospatial Intelligence for Sustainable 
Futures**, explores how emerging forms of spatial intelligence and AI are transforming our understanding of people, places, and the 
complex systems that connect them. We invite submissions that link AI-driven geospatial innovation with questions of sustainability, 
resilience, biodiversity, accessibility, and spatial justice across scales—from everyday mobility to global change.
