Welcome
======================

The *Geoinformatics Research Days* event is the annual gathering for geoinformatics experts in Finland, 
which has been arranged by the member universities of the **Finnish University Network for Geoinformatics (Fiuginet)** 
for over 10 years. The event will take place on May 11-12, 2026 and will be organized by *University of Helsinki* together 
with the *Fiuginet* network, hosted in *Helsinki, Finland.* In addition, the Geoinformatics Research Days 2026 will 
include the final event of the `Geospatial Challenge Camp 2026 <https://challenge-camp.geoportti.fi/>`_ where teams present their results.

Call for Submissions
======================

Geoinformatics Research Days welcomes contributions from all areas of geospatial research and applications, providing an open platform 
for sharing ideas, methods, and innovations across the discipline. This year's **spotlight theme, Geospatial Intelligence for Sustainable 
Futures**, explores how emerging forms of spatial intelligence and AI are transforming our understanding of people, places, and the 
complex systems that connect them. We invite submissions that link AI-driven geospatial innovation with questions of sustainability, 
resilience, biodiversity, accessibility, and spatial justice across scales—from everyday mobility to global change.

Topics of interest
----------------------

Submissions are welcome in, but not limited to, the following areas:

1. Geospatial Intelligence and AI
2. Environmental Change, Resilience, Biodiversity and Sustainability 
3. Urban Analytics, Mobility, and Smart Cities   
4. Participatory GIS, Citizen Science, and Spatial Justice 
5. Remote Sensing, Earth Observation, and Spatial Modelling 
6. Geovisualization, Cartography, and Communication    
7. Open Geospatial Data, Reproducibility, and FAIR Practices
8. Education, Methods, and Emerging Technologies in Geoinformatics
9. General Advances in GIScience and Geoinformatics      

Your participation in the Geoinformatics Research Days 2026 will make a significant contributions, foster collaboration,
and shape the future of Geoinformatics. Together, let's advance the understanding and application of geospatial technologies 
for a more sustainable and interconnected world.
